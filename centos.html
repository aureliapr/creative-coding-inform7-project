    <h1 id="title">Crossing Wyoming</h1>
    <div id="poem">
        <p>Crossing Wyoming, it follows around the northern edge of the Great Basin to the plains of the Columbia.</p>
        <p>I especially mention the sympathetic attitude of Admiral Muñoz Hurtado, head of the Chilian Navy, and Captain Luis Pardo, who commanded the Yelcho on our last and successful venture.</p>
        <p>Esso cresce in grandi quantità compatte nelle vallate che conducono al Barca ed al Mareb.</p>
        <p>The entry in Joyce’s diary shows that he had very strong forebodings of disaster when Mackintosh and Hayward left.</p>
        <p>In this passing from the older to the newer members of the tertiary system we meet with many chasms, but none which separate entirely, by a broad line of demarcation, one state of the organic world from another.</p>
        <p>Here the wind not only encounters the cold air of the mountains, but, what is far more effective as a refrigerating cause, the aerial current is made to flow upwards, and to ascend to a height of several thousand feet above the sea.</p>
        <p>Every large area covered by a dense mass of peat, bears ample testimony to the fact, that several million tons of carbon have been taken from the air, by the powers of vegetable life, and stored up in the earth's crust, a large quantity of oxygen having been at the same time set free; but we cannot infer from these circumstances, that the constitution of the atmosphere has been materially deranged, until we have data for estimating the rate at which dead animal and vegetable substances are daily putrefying,--organic remains and various calcareous rocks decomposing, and volcanic regions emitting fresh volumes of carbonic acid gas.</p>
